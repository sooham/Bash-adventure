# Bash Adventure
Welcome!

Bash Adventure is a game which teaches players the most commonly used **Bash**
commands. The player learns the syntax, use-case and side-effect of each command
by traversing through the Mac OS X filesystem in a Zork style adventure game.
Each bash command is mapped to an available player action - say `cd` commmand can
be used to open doors and `rm -rf` to kill a snake.

## Instructions
1. Open the Terminal Application (located in **Applications > Utilities > Terminal **).
2. Open this project in Finder and read START.txt to learn the basics of the terminal
    and follow customised setup instructions.
3. Navigate to the Game folder and close all other finder windows.
4. You're all set to play!
