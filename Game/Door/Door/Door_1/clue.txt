You find a corpse of an old traveler like you.
Suddenly a loud bang is heard from behind you followed by a evil voice.

‘LEAVE this place. Your death awaits if you are to tread more…’
The voice faints until it is no longer audible.

You remain in the search for the treasure of Zsh.

Clue: 

Try ‘cd ..’ to go to the previous room.
